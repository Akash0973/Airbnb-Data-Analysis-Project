## Approach-

1) Create an account on MongoDB Atlas and initialize sample dataset
2) Connect to this collection using pymongo in python to import this dataset and perform EDA and clean the data
3) After cleaning, perform various data analysis as required. This involves geovisualization
4) Use this data to create charts on Tableau and display on the streamlit app using tableauserverclient
5) Run the app using streamlit run App.py in the command prompt

# Running the app-

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries from requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app using the command: streamlit run app.py
