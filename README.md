# Airbnb-Data-Analysis-Project

## Problem Statement-

This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.

## Dataset-

Sample Airbnb dataset on MongoDB Atlas site.

## Approach-

1) Create an account on MongoDB Atlas and initialize the sample dataset
2) Connect to this collection using Pymongo in python to import this dataset to perform EDA and clean the data
3) After cleaning, perform various data analyses as required. This involves visualization
4) Use this data to create charts on Tableau and display on the Streamlit app using tableauserverclient
5) Run the app using streamlit run App.py in the command prompt

# Running the app-

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries from requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app using the command: streamlit run app.py
